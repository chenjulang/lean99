# Lean 99: Ninety-Nine Lean Probelms

These are Lean translations of [Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), which are themselves translations of [Ninety-Nine Lisp Probelms](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html).

## How to Play

Every Lean code block in this book has a button to jump to the Lean Web Playground. Replace the `sorry` with your own code so that the test code passes.

You can see an answer by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-play"></i> button in the top right-hand corner of each page.

Good luck! üëç
